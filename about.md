##### This Blog in a Nutshell  

Instantiated upon my entry to the [Flatiron School's](https://flatironschool.com/) Web Dev Fellowship program, this blog journalizes my thoughts on the technological concepts and methods I've found especially interesting or challenging to adapt to since I started learning how to code in a more organized fashion. I like to bring my own sense of humor and creativity into coding by applying methods to subjects they are not usually associated with, such as using soap opera characters to grasp database model associations, or poetry about cats to test regular expressions.
